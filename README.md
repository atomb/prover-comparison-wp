This repository contains an example proof used as an exercise in
comparing a variety of theorem provers.

The proof itself shows that a weakest precondition function for a simple
imperative language agrees with a small-step operational semantics. It
can be discharged by induction on the evaluation step taken, with
minimal additional reasoning. However, this minimal reasoning takes
different amounts of effort in different systems.
